# ProceduralWorld
I developed a C++ application using OpenGL as graphics API. The application generates a terrain and
different biomes procedurally, using two heightmaps created with the Fractal Noise algorithm. The
application uses a third heightmap to spawn a specific number of trees and place them in random
positions. Some post-processing effects are applied.
